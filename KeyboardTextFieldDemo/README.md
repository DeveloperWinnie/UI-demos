Usage

Just drag and drop IQKeyboardManager class in your project. In your appDelegate.m write just one line of code. This will handle all UITextField/UITextView covering problem.

```  objc
//AppDelegate.m

#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import "IQKeyboardManager.h"

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    //ONE LINE OF CODE.
    //Enabling keyboard manager(Use this line to enable managing distance between keyboard & textField/textView).
    [[IQKeyboardManager sharedManager] setEnable:YES];
    
    //(Optional)Set Distance between keyboard & textField, Default is 10.
    //[[IQKeyboardManager sharedManager] setKeyboardDistanceFromTextField:15];

    //(Optional)Enable autoToolbar behaviour. If It is set to NO. You have to manually create UIToolbar for keyboard.
    //[[IQKeyboardManager sharedManager] setEnableAutoToolbar:YES];

    //(Optional)Setting toolbar behaviour to IQAutoToolbarBySubviews to manage previous/next according to UITextField's hirarchy in it's SuperView. Set it to IQAutoToolbarByTag to manage previous/next according to UITextField's tag property in increasing order.
    //[[IQKeyboardManager sharedManager] setToolbarManageBehaviour:IQAutoToolbarBySubviews];

    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    return YES;
